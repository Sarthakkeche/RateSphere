## ⚙️ Project Overview

**RateSphere** goes beyond a simple rating app by implementing a robust **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system. Built to handle complex entity relationships, the platform serves three distinct user types with tailored dashboards and permissions. 

It demonstrates proficiency in modern full-stack architecture, secure JWT authentication, strict input validation, and responsive UI design.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

### 💻 Frontend
* **React.js (via Vite):** For lightning-fast development and optimized builds.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For a highly responsive, modern, and clean light-theme UI.
* **Axios:** For handling API requests with interceptors.
* **React Router DOM:** For secure, role-based client-side routing.

### 🛠 Backend
* **Node.js & Express.js:** Handling RESTful API routing and server logic.
* **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** For stateless, secure user sessions.
* **Bcrypt.js:** For cryptographic password hashing.

### 🗄 Database
* **MySQL:** Relational database handling complex joins between Users, Stores, and Ratings.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🛡️ Role-Based Architecture
* **System Administrator:** Can manage the entire platform, add new internal users (Admins/Users), register new stores, assign Store Owners, and view platform-wide statistics.
* **Store Owner:** Possesses a dedicated dashboard to track their specific store's average rating and view a detailed log of which users submitted reviews.
* **Normal User:** Can browse the platform, search/sort stores, and submit or update their 1-to-5 star ratings.

### 🔒 Security & Validation
* **JWT Authentication:** Protected routes on both the frontend and backend.
* **Strict Form Validations:** Enforces complex password rules (8-16 chars, uppercase, special chars), string length limits, and prevents duplicate email registrations.
* **Secure Password Updates:** Users and Owners can securely update their passwords post-login, and utilize a pre-login Forgot Password flow.

### ✨ Dynamic UI/UX
* **Advanced Data Tables:** Includes sorting (Ascending/Descending) and real-time search filtering across dashboards.
* **Interactive Components:** Custom SVG star-rating components and responsive grid layouts.
